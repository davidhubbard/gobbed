# Gobbed
![Gobbed logo](icon/ic_launcher-hdpi.png) Gobbed is [Free Software](COPYING.md) for connecting to your vehicle's data buses.

## Design

Gobbed began life as a bash script to talk to almost any Bluetooth ELM327 adapter. Gobbed has now become HTML + javascript on:
* Android (native app that runs HTML+JS)
* Linux (as a Chrome App)
* ChromeOS (as a Chrome App)
* Mac OS (as a Chrome App)
* Windows (as a Chrome App)

The longer explanation and the original bash script are [here](https://github.com/davidhubbard/gobbed/wiki).

**Hackers needed:** It shouldn't take much work to create an iOS app. See [bug #6](https://github.com/davidhubbard/gobbed/issues/6).

## Quick Download

* Android: Google Play Store link
* Linux: Chrome Web Store link
* ChromeOS: Chrome Web Store link
* Mac: Chrome Web Store link
* Windows: Chrome Web Store link

## Hacking

I write using Android Studio. ([bug #3: add support for Eclipse](https://github.com/davidhubbard/gobbed/issues/3))

Here's how to run the code in Android Studio:

1. `git clone https://github.com/davidhubbard/gobbed.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio and choose Run menu > Run 'app'
3. If it runs ok on your device then you are ready to hack on the code.
4. Go to (TBD source dir) and take a look at (TBD source file). This sets up the main UI.
