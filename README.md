# Gobbed
![Gobbed logo](icon/ic_launcher-hdpi.png) Gobbed is Free Software for connecting to your vehicle's data buses.

## Design

Gobbed began life as a bash script for Mac OS X to talk to almost any Bluetooth ELM327 adapter out there. After thinking about it, Gobbed is now available as an Android app that displays a WebView.

**Android OS (bluetooth stack) > Native app with HTML+JS baked into it > WebView**

The longer explanation with bash script is [here](https://github.com/davidhubbard/gobbed/wiki).

## Hacking

I write using Android Studio. It won't be too hard to test building the project with Eclipse, once I have time.

1. Clone project source
2. Check that it compiles and runs on your device
3. Go to (TBD source dir) and take a look at (TBD source file). This sets up the main UI.
